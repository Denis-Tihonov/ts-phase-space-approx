## Abstract
The paper considers the problem of dynamical systems phase space reconstruction. Each
time series is generated by a system with a constant characteristics. For a new system with a
new vector of characteristics, state space reconstruction is impossible without an observation
history. A method is proposed that uses a single model for phase space reconstruction for any
dynamical system from the considered class. The model is a multilinear map, parameterized
by the vector of characteristics, that reconstruct the phase space for a new dynamical system
without retraining on new time sereis. The effectiveness of the method is confirmed by
a computational experiment on a set of time series recorded by an accelerometer for 24
individuals with different age, weight and height.

# PHASE SPACE RECONSTRUCTION OF DYNAMICAL
SYSTEMS FROM INCOMPLETE DATA

## Abstract
This study solves the problem of phase spaces reconstruction of dynamical
systems. Each dynamical system is described by a set of time series and additional
"constant" parameters. When a system with new constant parameters appears, identifying
its state space is challenging until a time series of sufficient length to reconstruct the phase
portrait becomes available. The study explores a method for parameterizing the linear part
of the map between phase spaces. The approach combines time delay embedding, principal
component analysis and regression models to define a model of phase space tansformations,
described by Jacobian matrices. The objective is to reconstruct the phase space from
incomplete set of data and the constant parameters. In the computational experiment, the
proposed approach is tested for reconstruction accuracy on a dataset of accelerometer data
from walking for 24 individuals of different genders, ages, weights, and heights.
